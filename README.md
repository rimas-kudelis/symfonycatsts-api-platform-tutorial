# SymfonyCasts API Platform Tutorial

This repository holds the code I worked on while coding along the SymfonyCasts API Platform Tutorial course.
I worked on a newer version of Symfony and API Platform than was used in the tutorial and I tried to do
better than taught where I saw possible.

Anyways, this repository is just here for my own future reference.

Also, since I was running everything in Docker setup, I committed that here too and put my app under `symfony/`.
Docker setup here is based heavily on https://github.com/eko/docker-symfony.
